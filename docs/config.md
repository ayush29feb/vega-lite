## Config

A Vega-Lite `config` object can have the following top-level properties:

| Property      | Type          | Description    |
| :------------ |:-------------:| :------------- |
| viewport      | Integer[]     | The width and height of the on-screen viewport, in pixels. If necessary, clipping and scrolling will be applied. |
| background    | String        | CSS color property to use as background of visualization. Default is `"transparent"`. |
| filterNull | Boolean | Filter null values from the data. If set to `true`, all rows with null values are filtered. If `false`, no rows are filtered. Set the property to `undefined` (default) to filter only quantitative and temporal fields. |


<!-- TODO: consider adding width, height, viewport, filterNull, numberFormat, timeFormat  -->

In addition, `config` can have config objects for `cell`, `mark`, `scene`, and `stack`.

## Cell Config

The smallest unit in Vega-Lite visualization is called a cell.  
Each single (non-trellis)  chart contains one cell.  
Thus, the width and height of the visualization is the `width` and `height` of the cell.  
For trellis plots (also called small multiples), cell `width` and `height` determine
the size of one plot inside the trellis plots.  

`cell` property of the `config` object can have the following size properties:

| Property      | Type          | Description    |
| :------------ |:-------------:| :------------- |
| width         | Integer       | The width of the visualization for a single cell (200 pixels by default).  This property is used only when `x` uses non-ordinal scale.  When `x` uses ordinal scale, the width is determined by x-scale's `bandWidth`.  |
| height        | Integer       | The height of the visualization for a single cell (200 pixels by default).  This property is used only when `y` uses non-ordinal scale.  When `y` uses ordinal scale, the height is determined by y-scale's `bandWidth`. |

the following grid properties:

| Property      | Type          | Description    |
| :------------ |:-------------:| :------------- |
| gridShow      | Boolean       | Whether to show facet grid.  (True by default)  |
| gridColor     | Color         | Color of the grid between facets. |
| gridOpacity   | Number        | Opacity of the grid between facets. |
| gridOffset    | Number        | Offset for grid between facets.  |

and the following fill and stroke properties:

| Property      | Type          | Description    |
| :------------ |:-------------:| :------------- |
| fill          | Color         | The fill color. |
| fillOpacity   | Number        | The fill opacity (value between [0,1]). |
| stroke        | Color         | The stroke color. |
| strokeOpacity | Number        | The stroke opacity (value between [0,1]). |
| strokeWidth   | Number        | The stroke width, in pixels. |
| strokeDash    | Number[]      | An array of alternating stroke, space lengths for creating dashed or dotted lines.  |
| strokeDashOffset  | Number[]  | The offset (in pixels) into which to begin drawing with the stroke dash array. |

## Marks Config

`marks` property of the `config` is a marks config object, which can have the following properties:


### General Marks Config

| Property      | Type          | Description    |
| :------------ |:-------------:| :------------- |
| filled        | Boolean        | Whether the shape\'s color should be used as fill color instead of stroke color.  This is only applicable for `bar`, `point`, and `area`.  All marks except `point` marks are filled by default. |
| sortBy        | Field &#124; Field[] | Data field(s) for sorting layer of marks.  The first mark will placed on the bottom.  `"-"` prefix can be added to each field to set descending order. |
| sortLineBy    | Field &#124; Field[] | Data field(s) for sorting points in each group of line.  `"-"` prefix can be added to each field to set descending order.  |
| fill          | Color         | The fill color.  This config will be overriden by `color` channel's specified or mapped values if `filled` is `true`. |
| fillOpacity   | Number        | The fill opacity (value between [0,1]). |
| stroke        | Color         | The stroke color.  This config will be overriden by `color` channel's specified or mapped values if `filled` is `false`. |
| strokeOpacity | Number        | The stroke opacity (value between [0,1]). |
| opacity       | Number        | The overall opacity (value between [0,1]). |
| strokeWidth   | Number        | The stroke width, in pixels. |
| strokeDash    | Number[]      | An array of alternating stroke, space lengths for creating dashed or dotted lines.  |
| strokeDashOffset  | Number[]  | The offset (in pixels) into which to begin drawing with the stroke dash array. |

<!-- TODO: add fill, stroke, fillOpacity, strokeOpacity -->


### Marks Config for Bar, Line, and Area Marks

| Property      | Type          | Description    |
| :------------ |:-------------:| :------------- |
| orient        | String        | The orientation of a non-stacked bar, area, and line charts.  The value is either `"horizontal"`, or `"vertical"` (default).  For area, this property determines the orient property of the Vega output.  For line, this property determines the sort order of the points in the line if `config.sortLineBy` is not specified.  For stacked charts, this is always determined by the orientation of the stack; therefore explicitly specified value will be ignored. |


### Marks Config for Line and Area Marks

| Property      | Type          | Description    |
| :------------ |:-------------:| :------------- |
| interpolate   | String        | The line interpolation method to use. One of linear, step-before, step-after, basis, basis-open, basis-closed, bundle, cardinal, cardinal-open, cardinal-closed, monotone. |
| tension       | Number        | Depending on the interpolation type, sets the tension parameter. |


### Marks Config for Tick Marks

| Property            | Type                | Description  |
| :------------------ |:-------------------:| :------------|
| tickSize            | Number              | Size of the tick mark. |


### Marks Config for Text Marks

| dx                  | Number  | The horizontal offset, in pixels, between the text label and its anchor point. The offset is applied after rotation by the _angle_ property.|
| dy                  | Number  | The vertical offset, in pixels, between the text label and its anchor point. The offset is applied after rotation by the _angle_ property.|
| radius              | Number  | Polar coordinate radial offset, in pixels, of the text label from the origin determined by the `x` and `y` properties.|
| theta               | Number  | Polar coordinate angle, in radians, of the text label from the origin determined by the `x` and `y` properties. Values for `theta` follow the same convention of `arc` mark `startAngle` and `endAngle` properties: angles are measured in radians, with `0` indicating "north".|

## Stack  

When either `"bar"` or `"area"` mark type is used with either `"color"` or `"detail"`
channel, a stacked (bar or area) chart is automatically created.  
For a stacked chart, `stack` property can be used to custo

| :------------ |:-------------:| :------------- |
| offset        | String        | The baseline offset style. One of `"zero"` (default), `"center"` <!--, or `"normalize"` -->. The `"center"` offset will center the stacks. The `"normalize"` offset will compute percentage values for each stack point; the output values will be in the range [0,1].|
| sort          | String &#124; Array<field> | Order of the stack.  This can be either a string (either "descending" or "ascending") or a list of fields to determine the order of stack layers.By default, stack uses descending order. |
